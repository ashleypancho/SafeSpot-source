This website is currently out of service, but source code has been pushed to this repository in order to preserve the code.

## What is SafeSpot?
SafeSpot is a web and Android application built around the idea of keeping people safe. The web app features the ability to save addresses that you know are safe, view hospitals, police stations, and fire departments in an area, and view recent crime in the area.

The companion Android application can give you directions via Google Maps API from your current location to a safe spot of your choice, and also features a quick-call 911 panic button as well as the ability to text designated friends if you are in trouble.

More technical information about our project can be found on the development.html and technical-overview.html pages when you download the source.
